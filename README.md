# Game Jam Aotearoa 2022

[Link to Jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-jam-aotearoa-2022)

_Original README from [Unity 2D Game Jam Template](https://github.com/peabnuts123/Unity-2D-Jam-Template) as follows:_

This is a project template for getting up-and-running quickly for game jams. It is configured for creating 2D games in Unity. Included are a bunch of common plugins, code and prefabs I use, a main menu and pause functionality, and some UI SFX. This is to save on overhead that would otherwise occur during the jam, setting up a new project and copying over any specific library code from other games.

The code included is all focused on automation and making code easier to write, it does not "pre-code" any features or mechanics (beyond menus).

## Contents

The project currently includes:

**Plugins**
  - [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)
    - A dependency injection framework, for implementing a [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) pattern in developing.
  - [NotNullAttribute](https://github.com/redbluegames/unity-notnullattribute)
    - A C# attribute for marking Serialized properties in the Unity inspector as required.
    - A console error is logged, and the game is prevented from running at all (not just when your GameObject enters the scene) whenever any "Not Null" fields are null.
    - Very useful for reducing errors in the Unity Editor, especially for non-programmer contributors.

**Scripts**
  - A small Easing library
    - Written by me, for adding juice to your game.
  - A bunch of utility extension methods
    - Vector extensions for fluently manipulating vectors
    - Texture extensions for performing common operations on textures
    - Rigidbody extensions for performing common physics operations on Rigidbodies and their attached colliders
  - A small Debug Drawing library
    - For drawing dots, lines etc. on the screen
  - PathStack
    - Class for easily working with FileSystem paths
    - Removes need for string operations, references to "Path separator" constants, etc.
  - PointService
    - A service for easily generating points in games
  - ThreadedCoroutine singleton
    - A singleton for easily offloading work to REAL background threads
    - Reminder: You cannot do any operations on Unity objects from a background thread
  - MasterInstaller
    - An "Installer" instance for Zenject that wires up a few simple concepts
    - Sets up Singleton reference to ThreadedCoroutine
    - Has some quick dependency injection hooks for injecting sibling components, instead of calling `GetComponent<T>()` all the time

**Prefabs**
  - _SceneContext
    - An object to add to your scene to pre-configure Zenject stuff

**Audio**
  - [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/)'s superb [UI Audio](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/ui-audio) SFX pack, licensed under [Creative Commons Zero](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

**Scenes**
  - Game.unity
    - Basic scene set up and ready to go for development, contains a _SceneContext instance and things.
  - Main Menu.unity
    - A sample Menu for playing your game. Has a screen for displaying a simple list of credits, and an "Exit" option.
